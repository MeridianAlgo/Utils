# Time Value of Money (TVM) - Core Financial Calculations

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This utility provides comprehensive Time Value of Money (TVM) calculations essential for financial analysis, investment evaluation, and capital budgeting. TVM is the foundation of quantitative finance and corporate finance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts

### **Time Value of Money Principles**
- **Present Value (PV)**: Current worth of future cash flows
- **Future Value (FV)**: Value of current investment at future date
- **Interest**: Compensation for use of money over time
- **Compounding**: Interest earned on interest
- **Discounting**: Process of determining present value

### **TVM Components**
- **PV**: Present Value
- **FV**: Future Value
- **PMT**: Payment/Installment amount
- **i**: Interest rate per period
- **n**: Number of compounding periods
- **Type**: Ordinary annuity (0) or annuity due (1)

### **Financial Applications**
- **Investment Valuation**: Stock, bond, and project evaluation
- **Loan Analysis**: Mortgage, auto loan, and personal loan calculations
- **Retirement Planning**: 401(k), IRA, and pension calculations
- **Capital Budgeting**: NPV, IRR, and payback period analysis
- **Bond Pricing**: Yield calculations and duration analysis

## ðŸ’» Implementation

### **Basic TVM Calculations**
```python
# Future Value of a Single Sum
def future_value_single(pv: float, i: float, n: int) -> float:
    """Calculate future value of a single present value."""
    return pv * (1 + i) ** n

# Present Value of a Single Sum
def present_value_single(fv: float, i: float, n: int) -> float:
    """Calculate present value of a single future value."""
    return fv / (1 + i) ** n

# Ordinary Annuity Future Value
def future_value_annuity(pmt: float, i: float, n: int) -> float:
    """Calculate future value of an ordinary annuity."""
    return pmt * ((1 + i) ** n - 1) / i

# Ordinary Annuity Present Value
def present_value_annuity(pmt: float, i: float, n: int) -> float:
    """Calculate present value of an ordinary annuity."""
    return pmt * (1 - 1 / (1 + i) ** n) / i

# Annuity Payment
def annuity_payment(pv: float, i: float, n: int) -> float:
    """Calculate required payment for a loan or annuity."""
    return pv * i / (1 - 1 / (1 + i) ** n)
```

### **Advanced TVM Calculations**
```python
# Net Present Value (NPV)
def calculate_npv(cash_flows: list, discount_rate: float) -> float:
    """Calculate Net Present Value of a series of cash flows."""
    npv = 0
    for t, cf in enumerate(cash_flows):
        npv += cf / (1 + discount_rate) ** t
    return npv

# Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
def calculate_irr(cash_flows: list, initial_guess: float = 0.1) -> float:
    """Calculate Internal Rate of Return using iterative method."""
    # Simplified IRR calculation using numpy
    from scipy.optimize import newton

    def npv_function(rate):
        return sum(cf / (1 + rate) ** t for t, cf in enumerate(cash_flows))

    try:
        return newton(npv_function, initial_guess)
    except:
        return None

# Effective Annual Rate (EAR)
def effective_annual_rate(nominal_rate: float, compounding_freq: int) -> float:
    """Calculate effective annual rate from nominal rate."""
    return (1 + nominal_rate / compounding_freq) ** compounding_freq - 1

# Continuous Compounding
def continuous_compounding(pv: float, rate: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate future value with continuous compounding."""
    import math
    return pv * math.exp(rate * time)
```

### **Loan and Mortgage Calculations**
```python
# Loan Payment Calculation
def calculate_loan_payment(principal: float, annual_rate: float,
                          years: int, payments_per_year: int = 12) -> float:
    """Calculate monthly loan payment."""
    periodic_rate = annual_rate / payments_per_year
    total_payments = years * payments_per_year
    return principal * (periodic_rate * (1 + periodic_rate) ** total_payments) / \
           ((1 + periodic_rate) ** total_payments - 1)

# Amortization Schedule
def generate_amortization_schedule(principal: float, annual_rate: float,
                                  years: int, payments_per_year: int = 12) -> list:
    """Generate loan amortization schedule."""
    monthly_payment = calculate_loan_payment(principal, annual_rate, years, payments_per_year)
    periodic_rate = annual_rate / payments_per_year

    balance = principal
    schedule = []

    for period in range(1, years * payments_per_year + 1):
        interest_payment = balance * periodic_rate
        principal_payment = monthly_payment - interest_payment
        balance -= principal_payment

        schedule.append({
            'period': period,
            'payment': monthly_payment,
            'principal': principal_payment,
            'interest': interest_payment,
            'balance': max(0, balance)  # Avoid negative balance due to rounding
        })

    return schedule
```
