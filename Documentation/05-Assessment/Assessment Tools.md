## üíª Coding Exercises

### **Exercise 1: Portfolio Calculator**
**Difficulty**: Beginner
**Time**: 15 minutes

**Problem**: Create a function that calculates portfolio return and volatility given asset weights and returns.

```python
def calculate_portfolio_metrics(weights, returns_matrix):
    """
    Calculate portfolio return and volatility.

    Args:
        weights: List of asset weights (must sum to 1)
        returns_matrix: 2D array of asset returns

    Returns:
        dict with 'return' and 'volatility' keys
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

**Test Case**:
```python
weights = [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]
returns = np.array([
    [0.01, 0.02, -0.01, 0.03],
    [0.02, -0.01, 0.02, 0.01],
    [-0.01, 0.03, 0.01, -0.02]
])

# Expected: {'return': 0.01, 'volatility': 0.015}
```

### **Exercise 2: Options Pricer**

## üìä Case Studies

### **Case Study 1: Investment Analysis**

#### **Scenario**
You are a financial analyst evaluating Apple Inc. (AAPL) for investment. You have the following data:
- Current stock price: $150.25
- Expected annual return: 12%
- Volatility: 25%
- Risk-free rate: 2%
- Market risk premium: 6%
- Beta: 1.2

#### **Questions**
1. **Calculate the required return using CAPM.**
2. **Value the stock using dividend discount model (assuming 2% dividend growth).**
3. **Calculate Value at Risk for a $100,000 position.**
4. **Assess the investment attractiveness.**

#### **Solution Guide**
```python
# CAPM Calculation
required_return = risk_free + beta * market_premium
# = 0.02 + 1.2 * 0.06 = 0.092 (9.2%)

# DDM Valuation (simplified)
dividend_yield = 0.006  # 0.6%
growth_rate = 0.02  # 2%
ddm_value = (150.25 * dividend_yield) / (required_return - growth_rate)
# = (150.25 * 0.006) / (0.092 - 0.02) = 0.9015 / 0.072 = $12.52

# This is significantly below current price, suggesting overvaluation
```

### **Case Study 2: Portfolio Optimization**

#### **Scenario**
You manage a $1M portfolio with the following assets:
- Large Cap Stocks: Expected return 10%, volatility 18%
- Small Cap Stocks: Expected return 14%, volatility 25%
- Bonds: Expected return 4%, volatility 6%
- International Stocks: Expected return 11%, volatility 22%

Correlation matrix:
```
    Large    Small    Bonds    Intl
Large  1.00    0.75    0.10    0.65
Small  0.75    1.00    0.05    0.70
Bonds  0.10    0.05    1.00    0.15
Intl   0.65    0.70    0.15    1.00
```

#### **Questions**
1. **Find the optimal portfolio weights for maximum Sharpe ratio.**
2. **Calculate the efficient frontier.**
3. **Determine the minimum variance portfolio.**
4. **Recommend portfolio allocation for a moderate risk investor.**

#### **Solution Approach**
1. **Use mean-variance optimization**
